# GWAS Tutorial

Here are two examples of using genetic data for some exploratory analysis. We will walk through some basic functionalities of PLINK, a popular tool for working with genetic data, and perform population stratification to see how dimensionality reduction of genotype data can show different ancestries across a large group of individuals. We will also be working with GWAS summary statistics for Irritable Bowel Syndrome to learn about some common ways of visualizing genetic data.
